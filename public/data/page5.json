      "text": "The Butter Robot is a small, highly specialized machine built with one purpose: to pass butter at the dinner table. While its design might seem simple, the Butter Robot symbolizes a deeper philosophical reflection on purpose and existence. Tasked with a menial and repetitive job, the robot gradually becomes self-aware, grappling with the futility of its existence, thus sparking existential conversations around AI and purpose-driven technology."
